I am a recent graduate of the Northern Michigan University Cisler College of Business.

While it took me a while to find my way, I took Introduction to Java and Introduction to Networking on whims, and they both really helped me find my path.

I've always been interested in computers, ever since our copy of the original Age of Empires refused to run.

Back in that time, we didn't really have the Internet to help us troubleshoot, everything we figured out how to do was trial, error, and more than a few tears.

But the thrill I got hearing that iconic score for the first time had nothing to do with its composition, and everything to do with a feeling of achievement. I had tackled a problem and solved it.

I bring this same mindset to opportunities now, approaching difficult configurations and troublesome implementations as an opportunity to learn. I can't promise that I can or will solve any problem under the sun, but I will learn from it, adapt to it, and use it as an opportunity to grow.
